"""Kyrgyz word list, and what it can and cannot claim as its source.

The header of this file used to describe its rows as a gold standard from
McCollum 2020, adapted to later rule changes. Two things are wrong with
that. Values edited to match the rules are no longer the source's values,
and the Appendix the list draws on is a separate supplementary file
(DOI 10.5334/labphon.247.s1) that is not in the archive, so no reader can
check the rows against it.

The rows are kept because they exercise the vowel-harmony behaviour that
Table 3 of the archived article does support, and that behaviour is
tested against the article itself in test_kyrgyz_ipa_letters.py. What is
removed is the claim that these particular values come from a source
anyone can consult.
