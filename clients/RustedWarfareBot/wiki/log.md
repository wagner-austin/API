# Wiki Operation Log

Append-only. Log structural operations (new hubs, decomposition, audits, cleanups) and live runs that produced findings. Routine page edits don't need a log entry — git history covers those.

## [2026-07-25] init | wiki scaffolded
Hubs created: engine-internals, headless-harness, game-mechanics, bot-architecture, multiplayer
Notes: initial scaffold via /wiki-init, SCHEMA v1.0 plus two domain additions (`game_version` pinning, observed-behaviour-over-inference citation hierarchy).

## [2026-07-25] probe | M0 headless feasibility
Pages written: harness-nodisplay, engine-name-oracle, multiplayer-portability-invariants
Artifacts: `wiki/sources/m0-probe/` — `nodisplay-boot.log` (336), `printunits.log` (1533), `jar-classes.txt` (1698), `main-strings.txt` (345)
Notes: `-nodisplay` boots the full engine in 1.32 s and ticks a live match with no window; asset index self-identifies as `dedicatedServer`. Boot log names engine objects and prints one obfuscated mapping directly. `-printunits` emits a complete unit stat catalogue. Game copied from the Steam install to `.game/` (2095 files, 451 MB) so runs never mutate the Steam tree and the build stays pinned against auto-update.

## [2026-07-25] probe | M1' — `-sandbox` reaches a live skirmish, blocked on one GUI method
Artifacts: `wiki/sources/m1-sandbox/sandbox-crash.log`, `sandbox-10x10-crash.log`
Notes: `-sandbox` boots straight into `maps/skirmish/[z;p10]Crossing Large (10p).tmx` — the same default `singleplayer.rml` wires to that button — with PathEngine costs built and units present. It requires an explicit `-width/-height`; `-nodisplay`'s default 10x10 fails earlier. The only blocker is `com.corrodinggames.rts.java.d.a.EnableScissorRegion`, which dereferences a null `slick.Graphics` on the first in-game GUI frame; the method only calls `setWorldClip`/`clearWorldClip`, so it is safe to no-op. `-safemode`, `-canvasgl`, and `-nopostprocessing -disable_atlas` all still hit it. The RML menu tree also yielded the full control API in unobfuscated names: `ScriptEngine.getInstance().getRoot()` reaches `startNew(String)`, `loadConfigAndStartNew(String)`, `setValueById`, and `hostStart(boolean)`. Also: the first crash uploaded a stack trace to corrodinggames.com; `sendReports` is now `false` in the pinned copy.

## [2026-07-25] build | Python harness scaffolded to the monorepo standard
Notes: `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, `scripts/guard.py` lifted from the sibling client rather than authored fresh; guard runs over src/tests/scripts inside `make lint`. First slice is `rw_bot.validation` (require_* validators), `rw_bot.harness.launch` (LaunchConfig with encode/decode and the verified flag set), `rw_bot.harness.boot_log` (structured decoding of the engine log), and the `rw-boot-log` CLI. `make check` green: guard 0 violations across 31 rule categories, ruff clean, mypy strict clean, 61 tests, 100% statements and branches.

Five guard rules shaped the design rather than being worked around: a local `errors.py` is banned (exceptions now live beside the code that raises them, with the shared base in `rw_bot/__init__.py`); `object` is banned in annotations (payloads are typed `Mapping[str, str | int | bool]`); `Iterator`/`Iterable` from `collections.abc` are banned; `except` must log or re-raise (the CLI no longer maps a decode failure to an exit code — it propagates); and weak assertions are banned. `pytest.fixture` additionally fails `disallow_any_expr`, so hook binding uses explicitly typed context managers.

Two real bugs were caught by tests against the archived logs: the timestamp prefix was stripped one character short, and the monorepo-root search test passed spuriously because pytest's basetemp lives inside the repo.

## [2026-07-25] decision | language + runtime split
Pages written: runtime-split-java-agent-python-brain
Pages updated: multiplayer-portability-invariants (rewritten for paragraph-citation), engine-name-oracle, harness-nodisplay
Notes: agent = plain Java (forced — javaagent in the game's OpenJDK 13, minimal deps to avoid classloader conflict); brain = Python (matches both sibling clients, reuses `libs/` + the enforced clients standard, numpy for grid-shaped planner state). TypeScript was the close runner-up — better types and one shared wire contract, but cannot consume the Python `libs/` and would fork the api/clients Poetry convention. Kotlin-everything rejected: zero IPC is real, but it discards the whole toolchain for a bottleneck that is discovery, not compute. Decisions run decimated at 4–10 Hz with the agent free-running between them, so IPC is not the ceiling; per-tick reaction goes through the engine's own standing orders rather than agent-side logic, which keeps pure dispatch intact.

Also swept all four pages to zero uncited paragraphs. The `paragraph-citation` family requires every prose paragraph to carry a `[^N]`, `[@id]`, or `[[slug]]` — currently advisory for concept pages but explicitly slated to go fatal, and the rule's own docstring names a 2026-07-23 tankpitbot incident (confident uncited inference) as the reason. Verified locally: 0 uncited, 0 dangling footnote refs, 0 unused definitions, all 9 source_paths resolve with line anchors in bounds, all 4 wikilinks resolve.

## [2026-07-25] build | M2 — the javaagent exists and the engine reaches a live headless skirmish
Pages written: agent-render-callback-noop
Pages updated: index (5 pages), hubs/bot-architecture, hubs/headless-harness
Artifacts: `wiki/sources/m2-agent/` — `sandbox-agent-running.log` (403), `sandbox-agent-stdout.txt` (49), `sandbox-agent-jstack.txt` (31)
Notes: the M1' blocker is cleared. `EnableScissorRegion(Z)V` is replaced with a bare `return` by a javaagent, and `-sandbox` now runs indefinitely: map loaded, PathEngine ready, `--- setRunning ---`, minimap built, `--- Mouse API succeeded`, no exception. Two thread dumps twelve seconds apart put the game thread at 4,984 ms then 7,968 ms of CPU, both inside `Display.sync` — the loop is live and frame-rate limited, not stalled. Uncapping that sync is the lever if the bot ever needs faster-than-realtime play.

Disassembly changed the design mid-build. The obvious patch — preserve `h = enabled` and drop only the `Graphics` calls — is wrong: flag `h` has exactly three references, two writes here and one read guarding a branch that dereferences field `g`. A bare `return` leaves `h` permanently false and disarms that branch; preserving it would have armed a second null dereference. The narrow fix was the safe one only because the field census was done first.

Patched without ASM or Javassist. The agent loads beside obfuscated classes where every dependency is a conflict surface, and one property makes hand-rolling tractable: a no-op body references no constant-pool entries, so the pool is parsed only to find its end and copied byte-for-byte, leaving the edit local to a single `Code` attribute. Correctness is certified by defining and linking each patched class — HotSpot's verifier is the oracle, not a second reading by the code that wrote the bytes. Independently confirmed with `javap`: the method is `0: return` and every other method is byte-identical.

Not settled: `RenderGeometryPossiblyCompiled` dereferences the same null `j` at ~10 further offsets. The render path is proven to survive the frames observed, not proven clean. `Targets` is a list for that reason — the next callback is a one-line addition.

## [2026-07-25] build | agent wired into the Python contract and the check gate
Notes: the Java half is no longer a side artifact. `LaunchConfig` gained a required `agent_jar`, rendered as `-javaagent` ahead of `-cp` (the JVM stops parsing its own options at the main class, so position is load-bearing and is asserted by test). Required rather than optional: a launch without the agent is not a supported mode, and modelling it as optional adds a branch whose only reachable outcome is a crash.

New `rw_bot.harness.agent` closes the cross-language gap the type system cannot see: it parses the manifest the JVM will read and fails with traceable codes for the three reachable drifts — no `Premain-Class` (`RW-AGENT-001`), jar not built (`RW-AGENT-002`), and the attribute naming a class whose source no longer exists (`RW-AGENT-003`), which builds cleanly and then aborts the JVM at launch. Two tests read this repo's own tracked manifest, Java source and Makefile, so a rename or a moved build path fails in `make check` rather than in an engine crash log.

New validator `require_absolute_path` (`RW-DECODE-005`). It also closed an existing gap: `log_path` was documented as absolute and never enforced, so relative paths silently resolved against the game tree. Now enforced for both paths, and the existing tests were updated to match rather than the rule being relaxed.

`make check` now chains `agent-selftest`, so a patcher regression or an obfuscated name that moved in a game update fails at the gate. `make check` green: guard 0 violations, ruff clean, mypy strict clean, 88 tests (was 61), 100% statements and branches, agent-selftest OK.

## [2026-07-25] structure | evidence moved out of runs/
Notes: probe artifacts relocated `runs/m0-probe/` → `wiki/sources/m0-probe/` and all citations repointed. Cause: the api monorepo's root `.gitignore` excludes `**/runs/` as a DIRECTORY, and git cannot re-include a path below an excluded directory — so cited evidence under `runs/` could never be versioned, and every citation would have failed `source-path-exists` anywhere but this machine. `wiki/sources/` also matches the archive convention the workspace's registered wikis already use. The root `*.log` file-pattern exclusion is negated locally via `!wiki/sources/**`, which works precisely because it is a file pattern rather than a directory one.
